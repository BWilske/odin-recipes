    <h2>Spaghetti</h2>
    <img src="../pictures/momspaghetti.jpeg" alt="spaghetti">
    <p>mama mia thassa spicy meatball. With my italian heritage i sure know how to cook a good spaghetti.
        unfortunately for you guys i dont really wanna share my secrets so instead well be learning to make spaghetti from a can.
        spaghetti is a great dish if youre the average american who must consume at least 10 percent of their bodyweight in easily processed carbs per day.
        This will get you at least halfway there and the noodles are super easy so you can make this dish even if youre lazy!
