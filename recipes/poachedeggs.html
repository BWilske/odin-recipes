    <p>Poached eggs are a breakfast time favorite of mine.
        theyre super easy when you get the hang of it, 
        and when youre a mother of 12 the idea of just swirling the water and dumping everybodys food inside is very appealing
        The eggs should be shaped like a teardrop if cooked properly, and go great over toast with butter, hollandaise, or avocado.
