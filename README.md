Hello my name is Brent Wilske.

Ive been dabbling around with coding for awhile now, and ive decided to finally take the plunge to learning enough to become a front end developer.

I dont know much yet, mostly some html, and a bit of css that ive used to make a static photography website to show off my girlfriends photography work.

This website will be a good refresher and launching off point to figure out exactly what I do and dont remember
